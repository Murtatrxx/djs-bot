## Node style
We will write in the style of node.js.

Even our code written for the browser will utilize the node.js style of modules thanks to browserify, a tool for bundling node modules for the browser.

This means that we won’t cover the RequireJS/AMD toolset for javascript development, but will focus on node/CommonJS modules.

You’ll learn more about this later in the book as we go into depth with browserify and node modules.

But for now, know that this book will be applicable to pretty much any javascript you write, and will provide additional resources for writing in the style of node.js.
