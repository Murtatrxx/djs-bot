This is normal.\nYou will forget commas, or type semi-colons instead of colons, or type something with a capital letter that’s supposed to be all lowercase.\nYou will run a program and spend agonizing minutes wondering why it spits errors, then realize you haven’t downloaded the needed dependencies.\n**You’re going to fuck up.**\nBut that’s OK, because you’re OK with fucking up.\nThis course is meant to help guide you past common fuck-ups, but it won’t solve all your problems for you.\nYour mastery of programming relies on how motivated you are to learn, and how diligent you are in solving frustrating errors.Keep coding."
